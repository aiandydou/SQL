#Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

#Solution:

解法一：
SELECT City FROM Station
   WHERE (City LIKE 'A%' OR City LIKE 'E%' OR City LIKE 'I%'
  OR  City LIKE 'O%' OR City LIKE 'U%') AND (City LIKE '%A' OR City LIKE '%E' OR City LIKE '%I' OR  City LIKE '%O' OR City LIKE '%U')
这种解法虽然能解决问题，但是是比较笨的办法，如果有30个字母或者之类的，效率就很低。

解法二：
SELECT City FROM Station
    where city like '[aeiou]%' AND city like '%[aeiou]'
    
解法三：
SELECT City FROM Station
    where city like '[aeiou]%[aeiou]'
