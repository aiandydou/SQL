Sample Input

Sample Output

Samantha
Julia
Scarlet

Explanation

See the following table:



Now,

Samantha's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 11.55
Julia's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 12.12
Scarlet's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 15.2
Ashley's best friend did NOT get offered a higher salary than her
The name output, when ordered by the salary offered to their friends, will be:

Samantha
Julia
Scarlet

#Solution
解法一：
SELECT a.name From students a 
    inner join Friends b 
    on a.id=b.id
    inner join packages c
    on a.id=c.id
    inner join packages d
    on b.friend_id=d.id
where c.salary<d.salary
order by d.salary

解析：
题目里面有三个表：students,friends,packages.
students inner join friends 之后可以得到一个student 表，一个friends 表。
students inner join packages c 之后可以得到students salary的信息。
friends inner join packages d 之后可以得到friends salary的信息。
然后再用where比较一下，得出相应的结果。
