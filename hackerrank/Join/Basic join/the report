You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.



Grades contains the following data:



Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.

Sample Input



Sample Output

Maria 10 99
Jane 9 81
Julia 9 88 
Scarlet 8 78
NULL 7 63
NULL 7 68

Note
Print "NULL"  as the name if the grade is less than 8.
Explanation
Consider the following table with the grades assigned to the students:
So, the following students got 8, 9 or 10 grades:

Maria (grade 10)
Jane (grade 9)
Julia (grade 9)
Scarlet (grade 8)

#Solution:
SELECT CASE WHEN G.grade<8 THEN 'NULL'
        ELSE S.name
      END,
      G.grade,S.marks
FROM Students s INNER JOIN Grades g 
    ON S.marks between g.min_mark and g.max_mark
ORDER BY G.grade DESC,S.Name,S.Marks asc;

思路：
ON S.marks between g.min_mark and g.max_mark 这句是凭记忆写的，具体的原因还得再想想。
另外，自己写的时候ORDER BY G.grade DESC,S.Marks asc; 和答案的ORDER BY G.grade DESC,S.Name,S.Marks asc;差了一个group by s.name这个，所以结果
也不一样。所以，这个问题也得再想想。
