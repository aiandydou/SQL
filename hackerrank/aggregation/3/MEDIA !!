A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Note: Oracle solutions are not permitted for this challenge.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

#Solution:
SELECT format(round(lat_n,4),'N4') FROM 
    (SELECT LAT_N,
    ROW_NUMBER()OVER(ORDER BY lat_n) AS rownumber
    FROM station
    ) as TEMP
WHERE rownumber=(select round((count(s.lat_n)+1)/2,0) from station s)

这个题目首先列出来一个新的一列，对lat_n排序。
然后选择中间的那个rownumber=中间的那个数。
1，2，3，4，5五个数中间是3=(count()+1)/2
（五个数+1）/2
